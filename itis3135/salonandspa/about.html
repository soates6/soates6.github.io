                    <h2>Our Story</h2>
                    <p>Previously known as Nice Nails, the salon had been a beloved fixture in the community for over 25 years, run by a family who eventually welcomed Alexis into their world. They taught her everything they knew, treating her like one of their own. As time went by and their retirement drew closer, they offered Alexis something more than just their knowledge — they offered her the business itself. Though she had little experience running a business, Alexis wasn’t about to turn down the opportunity. She turned to her mother, Ivy, an accountant by trade, and asked her to join the journey. Together, they stepped into the beauty industry, determined to keep the family spirit alive.</p>
                    <p>Today, more than a decade later, Salon & Spa Absolute is thriving, offering everything from nails and hair to skincare — and still carrying the heart and soul it was built on.</p>
