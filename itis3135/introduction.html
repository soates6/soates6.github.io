        <ul>
            <li><b>Personal Background:</b> I was born and raised in the mountains of NC. This is my third year in Charlotte.</li>
            <li><b>Professional Background:</b> I have worked a few internships mainly focused in IT work, but recently had one as a software engineer. I currently work for the school’s IT department.</li>
            <li><b>Academic Background:</b> I am a senior Software Engineering student with a minor in Computer Engineering. I previously attended community college and got two Associate degrees by the end of my first year after graduating high school. I then transferred to UNCC to get my Bachelor’s.</li>
            <li><b>Primary Computer Platform:</b> Windows 11 Laptop</li>
            <li><b>Courses:</b>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>ITIS 3135 - Web-Based Application Design and Development:</b> This is a requirement for my major, but this is something I am still very interested in.</li>
                    <li><b>ECGR 3183 - Computer Organization:</b> Final requirement for my minor.</li>
                    <li><b>ITCS 3112 - Design and Implementation of Object-Oriented Systems:</b> This is an elective course that I thought would be pretty simple for me since I have a background in OOS.</li>
                    <li><b>ITSC 4155 - Software Development Projects:</b> This is my capstone. It is a requirement, but I chose this one specifically because a lot of people told me it was a good option, and I am able to get a better grasp of how a group project based environment works.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>Interesting Item to Remember Me by:</b> My curls are natural. I had it cut over the Summer, but my hair used to be halfway down my back.</li>
