                <li><b>CRAP Principles:</b>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Contrast:</b> Poor. The site uses too many colors, fonts, and sizes without a clear hierarchy, making it hard to distinguish important elements.</li>
                        <li><b>Repetition:</b> Minimal. There is no consistent use of design elements, leading to a disjointed and confusing experience.</li>
                        <li><b>Alignment:</b> Weak. Elements are scattered randomly across the page, creating a disorganized and overwhelming layout.</li>
                        <li><b>Proximity:</b>Poor. Related items are not grouped logically, making it difficult for users to find what they are looking for.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><b>Assessment:</b> This site fails to follow the CRAP principles, resulting in a visually overwhelming and user-unfriendly design.</li>

                        <li><b>Alignment:</b> Strong. Elements are aligned logically, creating a clean and structured layout that guides the userâ€™s eye.</li>
